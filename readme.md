# New World Market Tool
This program scrapes market data from New World by first gathering screenshots of the market and from there parsing the price data from orders on each screenshot.

## Notes on usage

* Images used for navigation are taken from game running full-screen @ 1920x 1080.

* Images used to parse are extracted directly from screenshots using something like paint.

* The average price isn't a true average, but rather an average of just the top orders included in the screenshot.
