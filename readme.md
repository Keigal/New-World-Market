images used for navigation are taken from game running full-screen @ 1920x 1080

images used to parse are extracted directly from screenshots# New-World-Market

open-cv is having accuracy images with identifying orders, i'm thinking this is due to the amount of variables in each order. since this program is primarily going to be tracking resource values i think a potential solution would be to identifiy the 3 dashes in the middle of each order and from there draw the bigger box.
